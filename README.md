# delu.live - Gig Delivery Platform

A modern delivery and gig platform built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project

### Firebase Setup (Required)

1. **Create a Firebase Project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Click "Create a project" or select an existing project
   - Enable the following services:
     - Authentication (Email/Password)
     - Firestore Database
     - Storage
     - Analytics (optional)

2. **Get Your Firebase Configuration**
   - In Firebase Console, go to Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è icon)
   - Scroll down to "Your apps" section
   - Click the web app icon (`</>`) or "Add app" if none exists
   - Register your app with a nickname (e.g., "delu-web")
   - Copy the configuration object

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root
   - Add your Firebase configuration:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

**Important**: Never commit `.env.local` to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

### 4. Firestore Database Structure

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789012
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

4. **Configure Firestore Security Rules**
   - In Firebase Console, go to Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules
   - Use these basic rules for development:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Gigs are readable by all authenticated users
    match /gigs/{gigId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Admin-only collections
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.isAdmin == true;
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Configure Storage Security Rules**
   - In Firebase Console, go to Storage ‚Üí Rules
   - Use these rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Type Safety
Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions for all data structures.

## üöÄ Deployment

1. **Build the project**
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Set production environment variables**

   - Ensure all `VITE_` prefixed variables are set

3. **Deploy to your hosting provider**
   - Firebase Hosting
   - Vercel
   - Netlify
   - Or any static hosting service

## üîê Security

- API keys and sensitive data stored in environment variables

## Firebase Services Usage

### Authentication Service
- Handles user registration and login
- Manages user sessions and authentication state
- Supports email/password authentication

### Firestore Service
- Comprehensive CRUD operations for all data models
- Real-time data synchronization
- Optimized queries with pagination support

### Storage Service
- File upload with progress tracking
- Organized folder structure for different file types
- Automatic file naming and URL generation

## Development Notes

- All Firebase configuration is loaded from environment variables for security
- The app uses TypeScript for type safety across all Firebase operations
- Firebase services are modularized for easy maintenance and testing
- Real-time listeners are available for live data updates

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables and not exposed in client code
- Firestore and Storage rules should be configured to match your security requirements
- User authentication is required for all data operations
- File uploads are validated on both client and server side
